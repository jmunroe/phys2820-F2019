You will need to create a new function `FallingBallStepper` that yields the output at every time step. Your program should call a new function `FallingBallPlot` that plots both the numerical results **and** the analytical solution for all time steps. Be sure to include a legend and label your axes. Run your program in a Jupyter notebook to show your plot.\n",

How much smaller does $\\Delta t$ have to be to reduce the error in the numerical results by a factor of two for the same final time? What about a factor of four? How does the error depend on $\\Delta t$?\n",
